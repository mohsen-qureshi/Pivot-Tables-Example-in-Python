# Pivot-Tables-Example-in-Python
An example of a Python script I wrote to create pivot tables for a work related dataset on card applications. 

I was using Excel pivot tables almost daily to report application numbers, so I created a python program to do take the manual work out for me. 

I look at total approved vs failed applications, daily application numbers, and application questions results amongst other things.
